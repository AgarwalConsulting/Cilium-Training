```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

#### Linux Network Namespaces

Network namespaces is a part of containerization technology that is used by the Linux kernel to provide isolation between containers.

It allows, for example, a container to have its own network stack, its own networking configuration, and its own routing configuration.

---

- The tool that is used to operate with `network ns`: `iproute2`

- Network namespaces are stored in `/var/run/netns`

- There are two types of network namespaces:

  - Root namespace `ip link`
  - Non-root namespace `ip netns .. ip link`

Default docker networking mode: Bridge mode

---
class: center, middle

A `Linux bridge` is a virtual implementation of a physical switch inside of the Linux kernel.

It forwards packets between interfaces that are connected to it. It's usually used for forwarding packets on routers, on gateways, or between VMs and *network namespaces* on a host.

It forwards traffic basing itself on MAC addresses, which are in turn discovered dynamically by inspecting traffic.

---
class: center, middle

```bash
bridge add <container-id> /var/run/netns/<namespace>
```

---
class: center, middle

![Bridge mode](assets/images/bridge-mode.png)

.content-credits[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slce9Nu-NB0]

---

- Bridge + Veth + iptables
- Other solutions exist
- Overlay & Underlay
- eth0 + loopback

---

More info:

```bash
docker network --help
```

---
class: center, middle

### What about tools like Kubernetes, Swarm, Mesos, etc?

---

*For each container that is created, a virtual ethernet device is attached to this bridge, which is then mapped to `eth0` inside the container, with an ip within the aforementioned network range. Note that this will happen for each host that is running Docker, without any coordination between the hosts. Therefore, the network ranges might collide.*

*Because of this, containers will only be able to communicate with containers that are connected to the same virtual bridge. In order to communicate with other containers on other hosts, they must rely on port-mapping. This means that you need to assign a port on the host machine to each container, and then somehow forward all traffic on that port to that container. What if your application needs to advertise its own IP address to a container that is hosted on another node? It doesnâ€™t actually knows its real IP, since his local IP is getting translated into another IP and a port on the host machine. You can automate the port-mapping, but things start to get kinda complex when following this model.*

### Enter CNI

![CNI logo](assets/images/cni-logo.png)

---

- Originated at `CoreOS` as part of `rkt` (deprecated)

- Now a CNCF project

---
class: center, middle

*CNI consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI concerns itself only with network connectivity of containers and removing allocated resources when the container is deleted. Because of this focus, CNI has a wide range of support and the specification is simple to implement.*

.content-credits[https://github.com/containernetworking/cni]

---
class: center, middle

CNI is used by container runtimes, such as Kubernetes (as shown below), as well as Podman, CRI-O, Mesos, and others.

*To avoid duplication, we think it is prudent to define a common interface between the network plugins and container execution: hence we put forward this specification, along with libraries for Go and a set of plugins.*

---

#### What does the CNI project consist of?

- CNI specifications - Documents what the configuration format is when you call the CNI plugin, what it should do with that information, and the result that plugin should return.

- Set of reference and example plugins - These can help you understand how to write a new plugin or how existing plugins might work. They are cloud-agnostic. These are limited functionality plugins and just for reference.

.content-credits[https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cni-kubernetes]

---

The container/pod initially has no network interface. The container runtime calls the CNI plugin with verbs such as ADD, DEL, CHECK, etc. ADD creates a new network interface for the container, and details of what is to be added are passed to CNI via JSON payload.

- Container Runtime must create network namespace
- Identify network the container must attach to
- Container Runtime to invoke Network Plugin (bridge) when container is `ADD`ed
- Container Runtime to invoke Network Plugin (bridge) when container is `DELETE`ed
- JSON format of the network configuration

.content-credits[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2BS_kuQxBA]

---

#### Execution flow of the CNI plugins

- When the container runtime expects to perform network operations on a container, it (like the `kubelet` in the case of K8s) calls the CNI plugin with the desired command.

- The container runtime also provides related network configuration and container-specific data to the plugin.

- The CNI plugin performs the required operations and reports the result.

CNI is called twice by K8s (kubelet) to set up `loopback` and `eth0` interfaces for a pod.

Note: CNI plugins are executable and support ADD, DEL, CHECK, VERSION commands, as discussed above.

.content-credits[https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cni-kubernetes]

---

CNI must support:

- Command line arguments ADD/DEL/CHECK
- Parameters like: container id, network ns, etc...
- Must manage IP address assignment to PODs
- Must return results in a specific format

---

![Relation between Container Runtime & CNI](assets/images/relation-between-runtime-cni.png)

.content-credits[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMNbgmxmB-M]

---

Supported CNI plugins:

- Bridge
- VLAN
- IPVLAN
- MACVLAN
- WINDOWS
- Also IPAM plugins like: host-local, DHCP, ...

---

There are also 3rd party plugins:

- Weave by weaveworks
- Flannel by CoreOS
- Calico project
- NSX by VMWare
- **Cilium by Cilium Inc**

---

#### Why are there multiple plugins?

*CNI provides the specifications for various plugins. And as you know, networking is a complex topic with a variety of user needs. Hence, there are multiple CNI plugins that do things differently to satisfy various use cases.*

.content-credits[https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cni-kubernetes]

---
class: center, middle

*Disclaimer* Docker doesn't use CNI, it uses Container Network Model (CNM) aka *Libnetwork*

---

### Challenges

- Updates to existing network configuration?

- Every runtime needs a different plugin?

- Security & QoS policies?

---
class: center, middle

Kubernetes chose simplicity and skipped the dynamic port-allocation deal. It just assumes that all containers can communicate with each other without Network Address Translation (NAT), that all containers can communicate with each node (and vice-versa), and that the IP that a container sees for itself is the same that the other containers see for it

.content-credits[https://blog.octo.com/en/how-does-it-work-docker-part-2-swarm-networking/]

---
class: center, middle

`Kubenet` is a very basic, simple network plugin, on Linux only.

`Kubenet plugin`: implements basic `cbr0` using the `bridge` and `host-local` CNI plugins.

It does not, of itself, implement more advanced features like cross-node networking or network policy. It is typically used together with a cloud provider that sets up routing rules for communication between nodes, or in single-node environments.

## What is Cilium?

---
class: center, middle

Cilium is an open source software for providing and transparently securing network connectivity and loadbalancing between application workloads such as application containers or processes.

*Cilium operates at Layer 3/4 to provide traditional networking and security services as well as Layer 7 to protect and secure use of modern application protocols such as HTTP, gRPC and Kafka. Cilium is integrated into common orchestration frameworks such as Kubernetes.*

.content-credits[https://cilium.io]

---
class: center, middle

*A new Linux kernel technology called eBPF is at the foundation of Cilium. It supports dynamic insertion of eBPF bytecode into the Linux kernel at various integration points such as: network IO, application sockets, and tracepoints to implement security, networking and visibility logic. eBPF is highly efficient and flexible.*

![Cilium Features with eBPF](assets/images/cilium-features-using-ebf.png)

.content-credits[https://github.com/cilium/cilium]

---
class: center, middle

### Features

![Features offered](assets/images/cilium-features.png)

.content-credits[https://cilium.io]

---

#### Protect and secure APIs transparently

- Allow all HTTP requests with method GET and path /public/.*. Deny all other requests.

- Allow service1 to produce on Kafka topic topic1 and service2 to consume on topic1. Reject all other Kafka messages.

- Require the HTTP header X-Token: [0-9]+ to be present in all REST calls.

---

#### Secure service to service communication based on identities

Cilium assigns a security identity to groups of application containers which share identical security policies. The identity is then associated with all network packets emitted by the application containers, allowing to validate the identity at the receiving node. Security identity management is performed using a key-value store.

---

#### Simple Networking

The following multi node networking models are supported:

- **Overlay**: Encapsulation-based virtual network spanning all hosts. Currently VXLAN and Geneve are baked in but all encapsulation formats supported by Linux can be enabled.

  - *When to use this mode*: This mode has minimal infrastructure and integration requirements. It works on almost any network infrastructure as the only requirement is IP connectivity between hosts which is typically already given.

- **Native Routing**: Use of the regular routing table of the Linux host. The network is required to be capable to route the IP addresses of the application containers.

  - *When to use this mode*: This mode is for advanced users and requires some awareness of the underlying networking infrastructure. This mode works well with:

    - Native IPv6 networks
    - In conjunction with cloud network routers
    - If you are already running routing daemons

---

#### Load Balancing

Cilium implements distributed load balancing for traffic between application containers and to external services and is able to fully replace components such as kube-proxy. The load balancing is implemented in eBPF using efficient hashtables allowing for almost unlimited scale.

For north-south type load balancing, Cilium's eBPF implementation is optimized for maximum performance, can be attached to XDP (eXpress Data Path), and supports direct server return (DSR) as well as Maglev consistent hashing if the load balancing operation is not performed on the source host.

For east-west type load balancing, Cilium performs efficient service-to-backend translation right in the Linux kernel's socket layer (e.g. at TCP connect time) such that per-packet NAT operations overhead can be avoided in lower layers.

---

#### Bandwidth Management

Cilium implements bandwidth management through efficient EDT-based (Earliest Departure Time) rate-limiting with eBPF for container traffic that is egressing a node. This allows to significantly reduce transmission tail latencies for applications and to avoid locking under multi-queue NICs compared to traditional approaches such as HTB (Hierarchy Token Bucket) or TBF (Token Bucket Filter) as used in the bandwidth CNI plugin, for example.

---

#### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Event monitoring with metadata: When a packet is dropped, the tool doesn't just report the source and destination IP of the packet, the tool provides the full label information of both the sender and receiver among a lot of other information.

- Policy decision tracing: Why is a packet being dropped or a request rejected. The policy tracing framework allows to trace the policy decision process for both, running workloads and based on arbitrary label definitions.

- Metrics export via Prometheus: Key metrics are exported via Prometheus for integration with your existing dashboards.

- Hubble: An observability platform specifically written for Cilium. It provides service dependency maps, operational monitoring and alerting, and application and security visibility based on flow logs.

---

### Integrations

---
class: center, middle

![Cilium Architecture](assets/images/cilium-architecture.png)

---

### Cilium components

#### Agent

The Cilium agent (`cilium-agent`) runs on each node in the cluster. At a high-level, the agent accepts configuration via Kubernetes or APIs that describes networking, service load-balancing, network policies, and visibility & monitoring requirements.

The Cilium agent listens for events from orchestration systems such as Kubernetes to learn when containers or workloads are started and stopped. It manages the eBPF programs which the Linux kernel uses to control all network access in / out of those containers.

#### Cilium Client (CLI)

The Cilium CLI client (`cilium`) is a command-line tool that is installed along with the Cilium agent. It interacts with the REST API of the Cilium agent running on the same node. The CLI allows inspecting the state and status of the local agent. It also provides tooling to directly access the eBPF maps to validate their state.

---

### Cilium components (continued)

#### Operator

The Cilium Operator is responsible for managing duties in the cluster which should logically be handled once for the entire cluster, rather than once for each node in the cluster. The Cilium operator is not in the critical path for any forwarding or network policy decision. A cluster will generally continue to function if the operator is temporarily unavailable. However, depending on the configuration, failure in availability of the operator can lead to:

- Delays in IP Address Management (IPAM) and thus delay in scheduling of new workloads if the operator is required to allocate new IP addresses
- Failure to update the kvstore heartbeat key which will lead agents to declare kvstore unhealthiness and restart.

#### CNI Plugin

The CNI plugin (`cilium-cni`) is invoked by Kubernetes when a pod is scheduled or terminated on a node. It interacts with the Cilium API of the node to trigger the necessary datapath configuration to provide networking, load-balancing and network policies for the pod.

---
class: center, middle

### Hubble

---
class: center, middle

Hubble is a fully distributed networking and security observability platform. It is built on top of Cilium and eBPF to enable deep visibility into the communication and behavior of services as well as the networking infrastructure in a completely transparent manner.

*An observability platform specifically written for Cilium.*

---
class: center, middle

### Hubble components

---

#### Server

The Hubble server runs on each node and retrieves the eBPF-based visibility from Cilium. It is embedded into the Cilium agent in order to achieve high performance and low-overhead. It offers a gRPC service to retrieve flows and Prometheus metrics.

#### Relay

Relay (`hubble-relay`) is a standalone component which is aware of all running Hubble servers and offers cluster-wide visibility by connecting to their respective gRPC APIs and providing an API that represents all servers in the cluster.

---

### Hubble components (continued)

#### Hubble Client (CLI)

The Hubble CLI (`hubble`) is a command-line tool able to connect to either the gRPC API of hubble-relay or the local server to retrieve flow events.

#### Graphical UI (GUI)

The graphical user interface (`hubble-ui`) utilizes relay-based visibility to provide a graphical service dependency and connectivity map.

---
class: center, middle

### eBPF

---
class: center, middle

eBPF is a Linux kernel bytecode interpreter originally introduced to filter network packets, e.g. tcpdump and socket filters.

---
class: center, middle

*eBPF stands for extended Berkeley Packet Filter.*

---
class: center, middle

eBPF is enabling visibility into and control over systems and applications at a granularity and efficiency that was not possible before. It does so in a completely transparent way, without requiring the application to change in any way. eBPF is equally well-equipped to handle modern containerized workloads as well as more traditional workloads such as virtual machines and standard Linux processes.

---
class: center, middle

By leveraging Linux eBPF, Cilium retains the ability to transparently insert security visibility + enforcement, but does so in a way that is based on service / pod / container identity (in contrast to IP address identification in traditional systems) and can filter on application-layer (e.g. HTTP). As a result, Cilium not only makes it simple to apply security policies in a highly dynamic environment by decoupling security from addressing, but can also provide stronger security isolation by operating at the HTTP-layer in addition to providing traditional Layer 3 and Layer 4 segmentation.

---

- It has since been extended with additional data structures such as hashtable and arrays as well as additional actions to support packet mangling, forwarding, encapsulation, etc.

- An in-kernel verifier ensures that eBPF programs are safe to run and a JIT compiler converts the bytecode to CPU architecture specific instructions for native execution efficiency. eBPF programs can be run at various hooking points in the kernel such as for incoming and outgoing packets.

- Hubble can leverage eBPF for visibility. By relying on eBPF, all visibility is programmable and allows for a dynamic approach that minimizes overhead while providing deep and detailed visibility as required by users. Hubble has been created and specifically designed to make best use of these new eBPF powers.

---

- eBPF continues to evolve and gain additional capabilities with each new Linux release. Cilium leverages eBPF to perform core datapath filtering, mangling, monitoring and redirection, and requires eBPF capabilities that are in any Linux kernel version 4.8.0 or newer.

- Cilium recommends to run at least kernel `4.9.17`. (Linux Kernel 5.10 LTS Released in December 2020)

- Cilium is capable of probing the Linux kernel for available features and will automatically make use of more recent features as they are detected.

---
class: center, middle

### Data Store

---
class: center, middle

Cilium requires a data store to propagate state between agents.

---

#### Kubernetes CRDs (Default)

The default choice to store any data and propagate state is to use Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). CRDs are offered by Kubernetes for cluster components to represent configurations and state via Kubernetes resources.

#### Key-Value Store

All requirements for state storage and propagation can be met with Kubernetes CRDs as configured in the default configuration of Cilium. A key-value store can optionally be used as an optimization to improve the scalability of a cluster as change notifications and storage requirements are more efficient with direct key-value store usage.

The currently supported key-value stores are:

- `etcd`
- `consul`
